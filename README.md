# Waste_Segreagtion_model
An AI-powered solution that uses OpenCV to classify waste as biodegradable or non-biodegradable. Recyclable waste is converted into new products and sold through an integrated e-commerce website.
This website is a part of our waste segregation initiative. It serves as a platform to display and sell eco-friendly products created from recyclable waste identified by our OpenCV-based model. The aim is to promote sustainability by giving a second life to waste materials and encouraging responsible consumption.

Key features:
1. Showcases products made from recycled items (e.g., plastic, paper, metal)
2. Clean, user-friendly design with product listings and categories
3. Deployed using Vercel for fast, reliable access
